## nf-core/deepvariant version 1.0dev - <date>

This release marks the point where the pipeline was moved from lifebit-ai/DeepVariant over to the new nf-core community, at nf-core/DeepVariant. The [nf-core](http://nf-co.re/) template was used to help ensure that the pipeline meets the standards of nf-core.

In summary, the main changes are:

- Rebranding and renaming throughout the pipeline to nf-core
- Updating many parts of the pipeline config and style to meet nf-core standards
- Continuous integration tests with Travis CI
- Slightly improved documentation

...and many more minor tweaks.

Thanks to everyone who has worked on this release!
